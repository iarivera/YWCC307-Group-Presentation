# YWCC307-Group-Presentation
Repository where meeting minutes, as well as other documentation will go.

The final project for YWCC307 Professional Development in Computing. 
A group project in which we make a presentation for a given topic.

Group's Topic:
The Department of Homeland Security has committed to 12 cloud service offerings, 
including nine private cloud offerings and three public cloud offerings, as part 
of its commitment to the White House's "Cloud First" policy. By moving its disparate 
dev and test systems into a private cloud, DHS anticipates being able to greatly 
accelerate the delivery of new software and services. Server provisioning time should 
decrease from six months to a day, and the service will include on-demand testing and 
app management. Your team is asked to submit a tech proposal to the department of 
homeland security for a cloud implementation project.
